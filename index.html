                        üëã my name is Mariana Dementeva, I‚Äôm 30yo. I was born in
                        St-Petersburg, Russia. Since the war in Ukraine broke
                        out I fled Russia and was ‚Äúnomading‚Äù for a year. Only by
                        the end of January I finally landed in London together
                        with my husband. For the past 7 years I have been
                        working as an English as a Second language teacher,
                        mostly teaching adults online. Teaching is a really cool
                        occupation, but I guess currently I am at this point in
                        my life when goals and aspirations shift. I really enjoy
                        breaking down difficult concepts and trying to tackle
                        problems from different angles - basically work as a
                        teacher you do this every day.

                        I‚Äôm a proponent of lifelong education, so within these
                        years, I was trying so many different things. I am a
                        former cheerleader, sport is my passion, now though I‚Äôm
                        more interested in yoga and pilates - things that can
                        also help our mind. I tried learning illustrations,
                        design and project management, but nothing quite hit me
                        as coding. Coding is both: instant gratification,
                        namely: you see whether something worked out or not and
                        at the same time contemplation and deep concentration,
                        which takes a lot of brain power and drains you
                        completely, but isn‚Äôt that how we know we‚Äôve
                        accomplished something? I strive for fulfillment and
                        self-accomplishment, I believe that coding might help me
                        do it. Web development is massive uncharted territory
                        where you still are able to achieve great heights. I
                        can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm particularly ambitious - to me it,
                        perhaps, holds a more negative connotation - but I want
                        to apply myself, I do believe I‚Äôm capable of overcoming
                        new challenges. Changing career in a new country after
                        you are 30 sounds like an interesting challenge, I‚Äôm
                        willing to rise to.

                        Hobby page - is a pretty simple HTML, CSS page, mainly
                        consisting of html tags and some CSS styling, it
                        includes just a fraction of JS - the date is displayed
                        at the bottom of the page. This project helps with
                        planning the outlining future projects, to learn how to
                        start building. It was a good warm-up, just to see the
                        result instantly.¬†

                        Project Gallery - Flex-box based page, a great way to
                        practice setting up flex box and play with its
                        properties. JS here is a bit more challenging. In order
                        to get the button ‚Äúshow more‚Äù to work I had to implement
                        eventListener, Loop cycle and ‚Äúhide/show‚Äù class names.
                        Flex-box makes the gallery responsive, although, I have
                        to admit if I had more time I would have implemented
                        media queries.

                        Movie Data - is a project that made me feel as if I
                        started from scratch but was able to reach brand-new
                        levels. It was really mind-blowing not to get stuck
                        (which I did multiple times). The basic structure of a
                        task is rendering movies onto the page (using
                        essentially no html), interacting with a page by adding
                        a new movie and builting ‚Äúsorting‚Äù feature as well,
                        which would reorganize the page without reloading.¬†

                        random) - display results and score. I created a lot of
                        functions and used a comparative operator, also reused
                        code from the project gallery and movie data. The
                        project includes¬†READ.me with process description.
